**Hello!** I am data engineering consultant and graduated with an MPhys in Physics from The University of Manchester.

Some of **my projects** can be found here on my GitHub. I enjoy using quite a few technologies, but most of my public repository code is written in Python, Scala, and C++. See my pinned repositories below for what I think are the highlights.

To **learn more** about me, including the things have have done and can do, visit [my website](https://tjkuson.me/).

To **get in touch**, you are also welcome to [email me](mailto:mail@tjkuson.me).
