Hello! My name is Tom. I am a physics graduate and data engineering consultant.

I write quite a bit of code; some of my code can be found on GitHub. I enjoy using quite a few technologies, but most of my public repository code is written in Python and C++.

To learn more about me, visit [my website](https://tjkuson.me/). You are also welcome to [get in touch](mailto:mail@tjkuson.me).
